# A4PDFtoA6Booklet
I'm tired of making booklets by hand, that's it :)

---

###Python code that takes an input PDF file with 'n' pages and outputs a new PDF file with 'n/4' pages arranged in the booklet format as described:

Page 1:

Top-left section: Page n
Bottom-left section: Page 1
Top-right section: Page n-2
Bottom-right section: Page 3

Page 2:

Top-left section: Page 2
Bottom-left section: Page n-1
Top-right section: Page 4
Bottom-right section: Page n-3

And so on..
